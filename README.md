phpunit-examples
================

Hi guys, I have scraped all(not all till now, but going to be :) ) the examples from the Phpunit documentation website (http://phpunit.de/manual/3.8/en/index.html) and put it into a executable php tests. The idea is that you learn fast when you see somethig working. I will keep on improving this. Have fun
