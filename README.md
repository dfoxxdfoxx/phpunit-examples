phpunit-examples
================

Hi guys, I have scraped all(not all till now, but going to be :) ) the examples from the Phpunit documentation website 
(http://phpunit.de/manual/3.8/en/index.html) and put it into a executable php tests. The idea is that you learn fast 
when you see somethig working. I will keep on improving this. Have fun

Instructions to use it
----------------------

1. cd to project folder
2. Give executable permission to phpunit eg $ chmod aug+x ./bin/phpunit
3. Run the test by $ ./bin/phpunit --color <test name>
4. For example $ ./bin/phpunit --color 01StackTest.php
